# A set of jQuery plugins.
## History
'It's better late, than never.'

These plugins were built in 2010 as a part of bigger projects.

Almost 2 years I had pain in my.. head and now I release them.

### Why they are built?
The plan was:

1.  Try existing plugin.
2.  Find fatal flaw.
3.  Make your own.

### Do they deserve attention?
I think openTable and dteditable worth attention.

## openTable
Drop-in replacement for datatables.net plugin. And uses it's CSS.

Much faster and bug-free.

## dteditable
Replacement for www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable plugin. 

## notify
Inline pop-ups library.

## tabs
Tabs library.

## overlay
Overlays library.


## form
App-specific form library.
